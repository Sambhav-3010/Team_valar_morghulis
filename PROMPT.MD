I am building an AI-enabled analytics and insights platform that combines data from multiple work tools such as GitHub, Jira, Slack, and Email. It is meant for teams and organizations that already use these tools daily, and want a way to better understand how work is progressing, how delivery is evolving, and how people and projects are behaving over time, by extracting meaningful metrics and insights from this data.

The platform will unify data from all sources using email as the common identifier for people and project names as the common identifier for work. Based on this cleaned and normalized data, the system will compute well-known frameworks such as DORA, FLOW, and SPACE, which will then serve as the foundation for project-level and people-level insights.

The product supports three types of users. One type of user is HR, for whom insights are primarily people-centric and based on the SPACE framework, focusing on trends in collaboration, activity balance, and wellbeing signals rather than evaluation or ranking. Another type of user is a technical manager, whose primary concern is projects and engineering health, and whose insights are based on DORA metrics such as lead time, deployment frequency, failure rates, and recovery time. The third type of user is a non-technical manager or product manager, whose primary concern is also projects, but viewed through the FLOW framework, focusing on progress, backlog, delivery confidence, and timeline risk.

In addition to numerical metrics, the platform uses AI to generate interpretive insights on top of the computed data. These insights are not meant to replace judgment, but to help users understand patterns, anomalies, and changes over time, and to explain what might be contributing to certain trends. AI output should always be probabilistic, careful in tone, and clearly framed as assistance rather than absolute truth.

Your task is to redesign the user interface and, where necessary, adjust the user-facing functionality of the entire application. You should not feel constrained by any existing UI or UX. You are encouraged to rethink navigation, layouts, information hierarchy, and interaction patterns entirely.I want it to be creative and unique. Really push the limits of your design capabilites.

Use your frontend design skills to make the experience calm, insightful, and genuinely useful. Push for originality and depth rather than traditional dashboards. The final design should help users notice what matters, understand complex data intuitively, and feel confident using the product as a regular decision-making and reflection tool.


Do not mess with any current code , ignore it completely ( do not delete it either just act like its not there).
